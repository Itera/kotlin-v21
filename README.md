# Intro to Kotlin with Itera!

Welcome to our workshop on Kotlin üôå. In this course you will learn the basics of the Kotlin programming language. The main objective of the course will be to solve Kotlin Koans, a series of exercises developed by the authors of Kotlin to get you familiar with the Kotlin syntax. 

For the curious, there's also some examples in this repo of how you can implement a simple web framework in Kotlin using Ktor, and how to compile Kotlin into JavaScript.

## Getting started ‚úÖ

- Make sure that you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, either the Community or Ultimate edition. If not, you can install it on the [JetBrains website]( https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
- After installing and launching IntelliJ, open the Settings / Preferences Dialog choosing `File | Settings` for Windows and Linux or `IntelliJ IDEA | Preferences` for macOS.
- Select `Plugins` and search for EduTools. Install this plugin, and restart IntelliJ when finished. Select `Learner` if asked whether you're a Learner or an Educator.
- When you open IntelliJ again, you should have the option of selecting `Learn` in addition to Create or Open a project. Select `Browse courses`, and join the `Kotlin Koans` course.

Now you're ready to start programming!

‚ùì Are you having trouble with the installation? You can also solve Kotlin Koans in [an online editor](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans). However, we strongly recommend that you ask us for help first!

## Kotlin Koans

Kotlin Koans consist of six different sets of exercises:
- Introduction
- Conventions
- Collections
- Properties
- Builders
- Generics

Every exercise comes with a task description. Usually this description will point you in the direction of the documentation relevant for the specific exercise. You can also see the [official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) for reference.

Fill in all of the parts of the code marked with `TODO()` and select `Check` when you think you're finished (or `Run` in the online editor). Note that the first time you check a solution it may take a while. The plugin will tell you whether your code is correct or not. Remember that if you're having trouble getting a correct solution, you should always ask us for help before cheating and selecting `Peek Solution`!!! üòâ

Happy coding! üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª

## Other Kotlin Features

Following is a description of the example Kotlin projects included in this repository. They will be introduced at a later part of the workshop.

### Ktor
Ktor contains an example of a simple web framework implemented in Ktor. See readme in the folder for more details.

### Kotlin2js

Kotlin2js contains an example of how Kotlin can be compiled to Javascript, and thus be executed in a web browser, or in a  Node.js runtime. See the readme in the folder for more information.
